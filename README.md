Test Automation of Answer Digital
This is my automation test sending you by git repository. Here, in this project I have used tools like Java language, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven Project/Dependencies, Cucumber Gherkin (Feature File)  on InteliJ IDEA. 
The framework I have for the test is Page Object Model using TDD and BDD. I have created different pages for the different test cases and assertion pages for the different test cases and kept the element locators separately. So all the element locators, Utils class, LoadProps(for using TestDataConfig input, TDD) and relevant classes in SRC-main-java-org.answerDigital. most of the data like username, password, etc. have been kept in TestDataConfig file which is under SRC-test-Resources-DataConfig
I have created three feature files(BDD) for different tests and converted those test cases to Stepdefs in SRC-test-java-org.answerDigital class and test can be run from the RunTest class which along with Stepdefs in same class. 
Test report will be generated in “pretty format” location is: target/Destination/index.html (you can select the browser by right clicking ‘Open in Browser’ on index.html)
